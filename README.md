## Benthos Test

Experimenting with <strike>[Benthos](https://www.benthos.dev/)</strike>
[Redpanda Connect](https://github.com/redpanda-data/connect) to see if it could be useful.

Right now all this config does is read stdin, feed it through a pipeline, and print the results to
stdout. It also demonstrates error handling.

This is supposed to help me evaluate if it's feasible to have a custom personal unixy / scripty
event processing pipeline.

### Getting Started

1. Install Benthos
2. Run `make poc` a few times
